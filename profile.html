        <p>My name is Skyler! I am a marketing major at UNC. I'm also a cheerleader at the school as well. Cheering is my passion. Though when I'm not doing that I am usually in the gym. Some other interests of mine include painting, reading and listening to music. One of my favorite authors at the moment is Colleen Hoover!</p>
